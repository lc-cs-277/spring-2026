Monday/Wednesday/Friday 1:50 PM-2:50 PM  
Olin 309

**Text book:** Dive into systems. Suzanne J. Matthews, Tia Newhall, Kevin C.
Webb. Available [online](https://diveintosystems.org/). Also available in
[print](https://nostarch.com/dive-systems).

**On reserve at Watzek:** For those interested in the finer points of computer
architecture, I have placed the following two books on reserve at the Watzek
library:

* Computer architecture: A quantitative approach. David A. Patterson, John L.
  Hennessy, David Goldberg. Morgan Kaufman. 1990.

* Computer architecture : Pipelined and parallel processor design. Michael J.
  Flynn. Jones and Bartlett. 1995.

**Google classroom:** I will use
[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/ODI4NDU3NDAyNTU0) throughout
the semester to share assignment due dates and details about exams, and track
your grade. You'll need to log in your Lewis & Clark account to access it.

**GitHub:** I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/lc-cs-277/spring-2026) to
share notes, activities, and assignments. This is a one-way communication
conduit; you won't make any changes in there.

## Course description

Computer Architecture and Assembly Languages gives a broad introduction to how a
computing system works at the hardware level. This course will take you on a
journey from a program written in a high-level language such as C to the
electrical circuits necessary to execute this program efficiently on a modern
computer. Topics include binary representation of information, machine
organization, instruction set architecture, assembly and machine code, memory,
stack, compilers and interpreters, pointers, and digital logic.

## Learning outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Write C programs using explicit memory allocation and pointers.

* Explain the difference between a compiler and an interpreter.

* Describe the different phases of compilation.

* Describe how various types of information are represented in binary.

* Understand what an instruction set architecture is.

* Write simple functions in assembly code.

* Undertand how to decode an executable binary.

* Describe the fundamental components of a computer.

* Explain how pipelining and caching can speed up the execution of a program.

* Build circuits using simple electrical gates.

* Understand some of C's vulnerabilities and how to avoid them.

## Office hours

I hope you will drop by my office hours throughout the term, so I can learn more
about your interests and answer your questions. In fact, I would like to
encourage you to come see me at least once during the course of the semester. No
appointment is necessary to see me during office hours; simply stop by Olin 226B
or 309. If you would like to make an appointment outside of my office hours,
please email me at alaink@lclark.edu.

## Requirements

All assignments will be posted on GitHub and will be submitted through Google
Classroom. They are designed to help you master and apply what we are learning
in class. **Assignments are due at 11:59 PM on the day they are due.** Points
will be taken off if submitted late; in some cases, late assignments will not
receive any credit.

## Grade scale

I will use the following scale to compute your final grade:

Grade            | Point Range
-|-
**A− or A**      | 90-100
**B−, B, or B+** | 80-89
**C or C+**      | 72-79
**C−**           | 70-71
**D+**           | 68-69
**D**            | 62-67
**F**            |  0-61

Note that I may adjust your final grade in the class up or down in light of your
participation, attendance, and overall commitment to the class. The grade of “B”
reflects work that is normally done thoughtfully and thoroughly by students. The
grade of “A” is earned by students who consistently do outstanding work and who
show an unusually strong commitment to being active participants in the learning
experience.

## Grading

* Homework: 25%
* Labs: 35%
* Midterm: 20%
* Final: 20%

At the end of the term, I will drop your lowest homework assignment and your
lowest lab. The exams are pen-and-paper tests given in the classroom. Final is
comprehensive.

## Helpful tips

**Attend all class meetings.** The classroom is a place to learn new concepts,
to work through activities to reinforce learning, and to engage in discussions
with your professors and your peers. If you have to miss class for illness or
an emergency, please let me know and try to ask a peer to take notes for you.
Being on time for class is also important.

**Collaborate with your peers.** Form a study group and get together to talk
about the class. The sooner you get together with your peers to talk about the
class, the better. That way you can look over your notes right away, when they
are still fresh. You are likely to learn a lot from one another and find places
where you need clarification from me before exam-time. You may collaborate on
assignments, but you need to develop your own answers.

**Divide and conquer — split up some of the exam review.** When it comes time to
review and to prepare for exams, you will have another great opportunity for
collaboration. Split up readings and lectures among a group of people and have
each person prepare parts of the study guides and potential answers to exam
questions. Then trade study guides and get together for your own review
sessions.

**Get to know your professor.** Please feel free to stop by my office hours
early in the semester, and stop by often. I am here not only to answer questions
about the lectures and the assignments, but also to engage in conversation about
computer science (and life!) as a whole. I love hearing from students because
you are the keepers of many interesting ideas and perspectives.

## Course policies

**Attendance.** Attendance is key to master the topics covered in this course.
Participation in discussion and activities will help gain that proficiency.
If you must miss a class for any reason, please obtain information about the
the missed class from your classmates. Missing the midterm or final exam
disadvantages not only you, but also your classmates and me. Therefore, make-up
exams will only be given for very serious circumstances.

**Accommodations.** Please see me if there are accommodations that could help
you learn more effectively in this class or if you are experiencing barriers to
accessibility in our class. Some kinds of accommodations may require
documentation through the
[Office of Student Accessibility](https://www.lclark.edu/offices/student-accessibility/).
If you plan to take exams in the Office of Student Accessibility, please
schedule with them and let me know well in advance of the exam.

**Course withdrawals.** You may drop this course on WebAdvisor by Friday of the
second week of class and no W grade will appear on your transcript. After the
second week and before 4 PM on Friday of the 10th week, you can withdraw from
the course by submitting a Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office. In
this case, a W grade will appear on your transcript. **The last day to withdraw
from this class is Friday, April 3rd.** It is not possible for me to authorize
your withdrawal from the course after that date. At that point, you will need to
complete the course and take whatever grade you have earned. If you have
questions or concerns about your performance in the course, please talk with me
before **April 3rd**.

**Academic Integrity.** Academic integrity is an essential part of learning.
Plagiarism, cheating, or the deliberate misrepresentation of information will
result in failure of this course. Please avoid any behavior that may be
reasonably viewed as suspicious. Remember that helping a classmate to cheat
counts as cheating. If you have any questions about the use of generative AI
technology (e.g., ChatGPT) or plagiarism boundaries or about what type of
material you can access while working on an assignment, please see me before you
turn in your work. If you have any questions or concerns about academic
honesty, please come see me or refer to Lewis & Clark’s
[Academic Integrity Policy](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/).

**Other.** All college policies govern this course. Please see the
[Undergraduate Catalog](https://college.lclark.edu/catalog/) for any issues not
covered in this syllabus.
