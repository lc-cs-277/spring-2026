Doubly Linked Lists
===================

In this assignment, you will learn how to create (and to destroy)
doubly linked lists in C.  This work entails learning about how C
supports dynamic memory allocation.  In this regard, there are several
differences between Java and C:

- In C, you are completely in charge; no garbage collection!  You
  allocate memory with a call to `malloc()` and release that memory
  when are you are done with it with a call to `free()`.  See `man
  malloc` for more details.

- In C, `malloc()` returns a pointer to untyped memory (`void *`), it
  is customary but not required to cast that pointer to the correct
  type for use in your program.  Note that `malloc()` may return
  `NULL` if out of memory.  Your program must check for that condition
  as well.

- `malloc()` takes a size as an argument.  You can get help from the
  pseudo function `sizeof()` to figure out how the size of a data
  structure (e.g., `sizeof(struct list)`).

## Building Your Code

This assignment comes with a `makefile`.  To build your code, type
`make list.o`.  To receive full credits, the compilation must not
issue any warnings.

## Unit Tests

This assignment comes with unit tests.  To get full credit, all the
tests must pass.  To run the unit tests, type `make test`.

## Memory Leaks

One difficult tasks facing C programmers is to free dynamically
allocated memory properly: not too soon; not too late; just in time.
The utility `valgrind` helps us find memory leaks and other errors
when using dynamic memory allocation (e.g., freeing twice the same
memory).  The `makefile` runs valgrind for you.  Therefore the utility
must be installed on the platform on which you run your tests.
`valgrind` should be installed on all the machines in Olin 309.
Please find me, if you want to install this tool in your system.  To
receive full credits, valgrind must issue a clean bill of health (no
leaks, etc.).  To check for leaks, type `make leak`.  Typing `make` by
itself, runs both the unit tests and the checks for leaks.

A successful leak check should include the phrase `All heap blocks were
freed -- no leaks are possible`.

## Check The Values Returned By `malloc`

To receive full credits, you must check that malloc does not return
`NULL` (an indication that the program ran out of memory).

## What To Hand In

Hand in your one filled-in file `list.c`.

## Extra Credits

This assignment implements a doubly linked list of longs.  What are
possible alternatives, if you want to support a list of an arbitrary
data type?  For instance, suppose you want to give a user the ability
to create a list of doubles as well as a list of character arrays with
a single `list.h`/`list.c` pair.  What are your options?  I'm not
saying, it's going to be pretty.
