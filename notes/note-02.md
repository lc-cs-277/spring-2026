# Note 02

## Definitions vs. declarations

A declaration introduces a *name* and its associated *type*. A definition
allocates memory for that entity.

## Arrays

The declaration `int a[10];` allocates consecutive locations in memory for ten integers.

The declaration `double b[10][10];` allocates enough consecutive locations in
memory for hundred doubles (10 x 10). How are the elements of this declaration
laid out in memory?
